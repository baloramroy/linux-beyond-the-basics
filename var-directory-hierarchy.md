## **/var – Variable Data**

The **/var** directory contains **data that changes frequently during system operation**.
Unlike `/usr`, which is mostly static, **/var is dynamic and constantly updated** while the system is running.

Think of **/var** as the place where **Linux records its daily activities**.

Suppose a Linux server is running, right?

* Services are writing **log files**
* Applications are creating **temporary and cache data**
* System processes are updating **spool and state files**
* Databases and package managers are storing **runtime data**

All this continuously changing information goes into **/var**.

In simple terms:

* `/usr` → **What Linux uses to run**
* `/var` → **What Linux generates while running**

That’s why `/var` often grows in size and is commonly placed on a **separate filesystem** in production servers.


### **`/var/log` – System and application logs**

Contains **log files** generated by the kernel, system services, and applications.

* Used for **troubleshooting, auditing, and security monitoring**.
* Managed by **log rotation** (`logrotate`) to prevent disk exhaustion.

**Common Files:**

* **`/var/log/messages`** – General system messages (RHEL/CentOS)
* **`/var/log/secure`** – Authentication and security events (SSH, sudo)
* **`/var/log/audit/`** – SELinux and audit framework logs
* **`/var/log/cron`** – Cron job execution logs
* **`/var/log/dmesg`** – Kernel ring buffer messages (boot-time)

**Example Structure:**

```
/var/log/
├── messages
├── secure
├── cron
├── audit/
│   └── audit.log
└── dmesg
```

### **`/var/spool` – Queued (spooled) data**

Stores **data waiting to be processed** by a service.

* Files are **temporary but important**.
* Automatically cleaned after processing.

**Common Use Cases:**

* Mail queues
* Print jobs
* Scheduled tasks

**Examples:**

* **`/var/spool/mail/`** – User mailboxes
* **`/var/spool/cron/`** – User crontab files
* **`/var/spool/cups/`** – Print spool files

```
/var/spool/
├── mail/
├── cron/
└── cups/
```

---

### **`/var/lib` – Persistent service state data**

Contains **dynamic but persistent data** required by applications and services to function correctly.

* Data **must survive reboots**.
* Often contains **databases, indexes, and runtime state**.
* Backups of this directory are **critical** for service recovery.

**Examples:**

* **`/var/lib/mysql/`** – MySQL/MariaDB database files
* **`/var/lib/docker/`** – Docker images, containers, volumes
* **`/var/lib/rpm/`** – RPM package database
* **`/var/lib/systemd/`** – systemd runtime state
* **`/var/lib/selinux/`** – SELinux policy data

```
/var/lib/
├── mysql/
├── docker/
├── rpm/
└── systemd/
```

---

### **`/var/cache` – Application cache data**

Stores **cached files** that can be **regenerated if deleted**.

* Improves performance.
* Safe to clear if disk space is low (services may slow temporarily).

**Examples:**

* **`/var/cache/dnf/`** – DNF/YUM package cache
* **`/var/cache/man/`** – Cached man pages
* **`/var/cache/fontconfig/`** – Font cache

```
/var/cache/
├── dnf/
├── man/
└── fontconfig/
```

---

## **Additional Important `/var` Directories**

* **`/var/tmp`** – Temporary files preserved across reboots
  (unlike `/tmp`)
* **`/var/run` → `/run`** – Runtime PID and socket files
  (symbolic link on modern systems)
* **`/var/lock` → `/run/lock`** – Lock files for running processes
